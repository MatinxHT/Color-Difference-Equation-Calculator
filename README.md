Using 'numpy' and 'pandas'

de2000 by pyciede2000

To install: -$ pip install numpy -$ pip install pandas

Just drop the LAB standard data & sample dat in data.csv and run ,you will see the result.csv

This project is to solve the problem that when you use other people's code, you find the same raw data but get different results and shout out WTF too loud

cause they don't know how important the "standard Lab" is (China GB/T 8424.3-2001)

this code is easy for everyone to read and run.(using numpy)
